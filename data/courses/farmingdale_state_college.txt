ANT 312 Advanced Medical Anthropology
Medical Anthropology is a subfield of anthropology utilizing various
methods to understand factors that influence health, disease and its
experience, as well as medical systems. Advanced Medical Anthropology
builds on material covered in Medical Anthropology, moving from a general
overview and introduction, to the concentration on a specific culture,
its concepts of wellness and disease, the methods and practices used
for diagnosis and treatment, and ethics and health disparities. Students
will compare and contrast American methods and systems with another
society to gain a better appreciation for the complexities and diversity of
the human experience of health and disease, interpretations of the body
and healing, the construction and distribution of knowledge, norms, and
systems of medical care. The growing interest in global health and our own
diversity makes this a course particularly interesting to those preparing
for careers in health, international development, and health advocacy.

STS 350 Data and Society
Vast amounts of data exist online which chronicle aspects of our modern
society in great detail. Careful analysis of these data sets can uncover useful
information which may allow individuals, organizations, and governments

of these data being misused in critical situations, either deliberately or
as a result of poor training. This course introduces students to the skills
necessary to extract meaningful and useful information from this data,
the caveats associated with data mishandling and misuse, and the role
that big data and online algorithms are playing in shaping society. Tenets
